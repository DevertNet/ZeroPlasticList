It is also very easy to do without plastic dishwashing liquid. Simply mix your own washing-up liquid with powder.

===

The selection of washing-up liquids without plastic bottles is very small. Instead of plastic, a metal or glass bottle would be the alternative. But I couldn't find anything like that.

The best alternative to avoid plastic seems to be the use of powder. After a bit of searching, I came across the following product. I also picked out 2 liquid soap dispensers.
