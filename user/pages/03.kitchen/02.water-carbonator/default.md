Different types of water carbonators almost without plastic. A simple and inexpensive way to add carbon dioxide to tap water. No more need for plastic bottles and no more lugging water from the supermarket.

Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to find a water sprinkler completely without plastic, as there is always plastic inside for hoses, etc. You can, however, make sure that the water is made of plastic. However, you can make sure that the housing is made of metal and the bottles are made of glass.
