Learn how you can significantly reduce plastic in your water consumption. It's much easier than you might think.

===

## Tap water

The simplest and easiest way to avoid PET bottles is to drink tap water. You save yourself the hassle of lugging it from the supermarket and save a lot of plastic at the same time.

## What about carbonated water?

If you want to have carbonated water, that's no problem. Surely you know [water carbonators](../../kitchen/water-carbonator) like Soda Stream. There are also models without plastic.
You can find more information about [water carbonators](../../kitchen/water-carbonator) without plastic [here](../../kitchen/water-carbonator).

## You don't like the tap water?

It can happen that the tap water doesn't taste so good. This can happen especially in big cities.
One option would be to fill the water yourself from a nearby spring. The more convenient option, however, is a [water filter](../../kitchen/waterfilter). You can install it under the sink or directly on the tap without much manual skill.
You can find out more in the [water filter](../../kitchen/waterfilter) section: [Click here](../../kitchen/waterfilter).
