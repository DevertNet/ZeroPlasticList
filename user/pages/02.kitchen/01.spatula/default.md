I love cooking, but it's not always the most comfortable experience. One thing that's always bothered me is using a plastic spatula to stir my food. The problem is that these usually melt when they get hot, which can lead to lumps in your food and make it harder for you to control how much goes into each dish. If you're also tired of dealing with melting plastic spoons and forks, then we have good news! There are plenty of options out there for wooden spatulas that won't melt when they get too hot—and even better: they don't contain any harmful chemicals or toxins like plastic does! In this article we'll explore some different types of wooden spatulas (including those made from bamboo), why they're so effective at helping keep your hands safe while cooking and how much more comfortable they feel compared with plastic ones

## You can get wooden spatulas that don't made of plastic.

There are many different types of wooden spatulas, but they all have one thing in common: they're made from wood or another type of material. There are many different kinds of wood used for this purpose, but bamboo is often the most popular because it's renewable and doesn't contain any toxins like other polymers do. Wood isn't just good at cooking; it also gives off a pleasant aroma during cooking as well! If you don't want to use plastic in your kitchen because its harmful effects on the environment and our bodies aren't worth it to you (and neither am I), then consider purchasing some wooden spoons instead!
